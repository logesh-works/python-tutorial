Python doesn&#8217;t require you to understand the details of the computer in order to develop programs efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2) General-purpose<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Python is a general-purpose language. It means that you can use Python in various domains including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Web applications<\/li><li>Big data applications<\/li><li>Testing<\/li><li>Automation<\/li><li>Data science, machine learning, and AI <\/li><li>Desktop software<\/li><li>Mobile apps<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The targeted language like SQL which can be used for querying data from relational databases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3) Interpreted<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Python is an interpreted language. To develop a Python program, you write Python code into a file called source code. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To execute the source code, you need to convert it to the machine language that the computer can understand. And the Python <strong>interpreter <\/strong>turns the source code, line by line, once at a time, into the machine code when the Python program executes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compiled languages like Java and C# use a <strong>compiler <\/strong>that compiles the whole source code before the program executes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Python<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Python increases your productivity. Python allows you to solve complex problems in less time and fewer lines of code. It&#8217;s quick to make a prototype in Python.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Python becomes a solution in many areas across industries, from web applications to data science and machine learning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Python is quite easy to learn in comparison with other programming languages. Python syntax is clear and beautiful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Python has a large ecosystem that includes lots of libraries and frameworks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Python is cross-platform. Python programs can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Python has a huge community. Whenever you get stuck, you can get help from an active community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Python developers are in high demand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Python versions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Python has two major versions: 2x and 3x.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Python 2.x was released in 2000. The latest version is 2.7 released in 2010. It isn&#8217;t recommended for use in new projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Python 3.x was released in 2008. Basically, Python 3 isn&#8217;t compatible with Python 2. And you should use the latest versions of Python 3 for your new projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Summary<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.<\/li><li>Python becomes the solution in many domains from web applications, data analysis, data science, machine learning, and AI.<\/li><li>Use Python 3 for the new development.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This tutorial helps you understand what Python programming language is and why you should start learning Python today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":39,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pyprifix.netlify.app\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/43"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pyprifix.netlify.app\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pyprifix.netlify.app\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.pyprifix.netlify.app\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.pyprifix.netlify.app\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=43"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/www.pyprifix.netlify.app\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/43\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":55,"href":"https:\/\/www.pyprifix.netlify.app\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/43\/revisions\/55"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.pyprifix.netlify.app\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/39"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.pyprifix.netlify.app\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=43"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
